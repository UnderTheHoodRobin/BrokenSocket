> A broken (but functional) Python script to chat and send files over the same network or mobile hotspot — between two connected devices (vice versa).  
> Broken? Because it works on _my_ machine lol 😆

## 💡 What is this?

**BrokenSocket** is a lightweight Python experiment that lets two devices on the same Wi-Fi or hotspot chat and transfer files using nothing but sockets.  
No fancy protocols. No libraries. Just raw TCP — the way it was never meant to be used.

## ⚙️ Features

- 📡 Send files between devices on the **same network or hotspot**
- 💬 Chat between client and server
- 🔁 Works both ways (**vice versa**)
- 🧠 Pure Python (`socket`, `os`, `json`)
- 😂 “Broken” because it _only works perfectly on my machine_

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Connect both devices to the **same Wi-Fi** or **mobile hotspot**.
2. Run `Server.py` on one device:
	* It will show your local IP address (for example: 192.168.43.1).
3. Rub `Client.py` on other device:
	* When asked, enter the IP generated by Server.py.
4. Start chatting or use /sendfile to send files between devices.
